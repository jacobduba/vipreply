The Enterprise plan is $199/month with unlimited everything plus dedicated account management and custom integrations.\n\nSince you mentioned having 15 team members, the Enterprise plan would be the best fit. I'd be happy to discuss startup discounts - we do offer special pricing for early-stage companies."

If you need higher limits, please contact us to discuss custom arrangements.\n\nSince you mentioned 2000 requests per minute during peak hours, upgrading to our Enterprise plan would give you plenty of headroom.
